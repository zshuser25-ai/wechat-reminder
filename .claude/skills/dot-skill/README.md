🧑‍💼 &nbsp;Your colleague quit, your mentor graduated, your teammate transferred — taking their whole playbook and context with them?<br>
💞 &nbsp;Your family, old friends, partner drifting apart — and you want to hold on to the way it felt to be with them?<br>
🌟 &nbsp;Your favorite author, idol, thinker you'll never meet — but you want to know what they'd say about your question?

## 🆕 What's new in this major release?

### 1️⃣ From colleague-skill to dot-skill

No longer only built around the "colleague" scenario. A unified `/dot-skill` entrypoint sits on a general-purpose skill engine — one engine distills anyone, instead of being a colleague-specific script.

### 2️⃣ Three character families

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="33%" align="center">🧑‍💼 colleague</th>
<th width="33%" align="center">💞 relationship</th>
<th width="33%" align="center">🌟 celebrity</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"><sub>Coworkers · mentors · teammates · up/downstream partners</sub></td>
<td align="center"><sub>Exes · partners · parents · friends · close family</sub></td>
<td align="center"><sub>Public figures · creators · public voices · fictional characters</sub></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><sub>Work Skill + Persona two-layer architecture — learns both their technical standards and workflows, and their manner of speaking and workplace posture. Supports Feishu / DingTalk / Slack auto-collection.</sub></td>
<td><sub>🆕 <b>Photo-sharing feature coming soon</b> — your distilled relationship won't just reply to messages; it'll send photos and share slices of its day, the way a real person would.</sub></td>
<td><sub>Ships with a complete <b>six-dimension research toolchain</b> (subtitles → transcript cleanup → research merge → quality check). Not mimicking tone — reproducing their mental models and decision frameworks.</sub></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Each family has its own prompt pipeline, source-collection strategy, and generation template.

### 3️⃣ More Agent hosts

The old version only ran in Claude Code. Now it's cross-host across four:
Compatible hosts:

| Host | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🟣 **Claude Code** | Native slash-command support |
| 🟠 **Hermes Agent** | One-command install, `/dot-skill` works directly |
| 🔵 **OpenClaw** | Fully compatible |
| ⚫ **Codex** | Invoke by skill name |

Generated character Skills can also be one-command installed into any host.

---

## ⚡ Install

It's 2026 — you have an Agent, let it install itself. Open your Claude Code / Hermes / OpenClaw / Codex and hand it this line:

> Install the dot-skill skill for me: `https://github.com/titanwings/colleague-skill`

The Agent will detect the current host's skills directory, clone the repo, and register the entrypoint. Once done, type `/dot-skill` in any host to launch.

<details>
<summary><b>🛠️ Want to install it yourself? Click for paths</b></summary>

<br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/titanwings/colleague-skill <TARGET>
```

| Host | `<TARGET>` path |
|------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/dot-skill` |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/dot-skill` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/skills/dot-skill` |
| Hermes | After clone, run `python3 tools/install_hermes_skill.py --force` |

</details>

Generated character Skills can be published with `tools/install_claude_generated_skill.py`,
`tools/install_openclaw_generated_skill.py`, and `tools/install_codex_generated_skill.py`.

> For Feishu/DingTalk auto-collection credentials, publishing a generated character Skill to any host, Windows-specific handling, etc., see **[Detailed Install Guide (INSTALL.md)](INSTALL.md)**

---

## 🚀 Usage

In the host where dot-skill is installed, launch it — type `/dot-skill`, or just tell your Agent "start dot-skill".

It first asks which family you want to distill: `colleague` · `relationship` · `celebrity`.

Then enter alias, basic profile, personality tags, and pick a data source. All fields can be skipped — even a description alone can generate a Skill.

Once created, invoke the generated Skill with `/{character}-{slug}`.

### 🎛️ Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/dot-skill` | Canonical unified entrypoint |
| `/{character}-{slug}` | Invoke full Skill (Persona + Work) |
| `/{character}-{slug}-work` | Work capabilities only |
| `/{character}-{slug}-persona` | Persona only |
| `python3 tools/skill_writer.py --action list ...` | List generated Skills across all three families |
| `python3 tools/version_manager.py --action rollback ...` | Roll back a Skill version |

### 🔬 Celebrity Research Toolchain

The `celebrity` family ships with an end-to-end research toolchain, from subtitles to a finished draft:

```bash
# Download video subtitles
bash tools/research/download_subtitles.sh "<video-url>" "./tmp/subtitles"

# Subtitles → transcript
python3 tools/research/srt_to_transcript.py "./tmp/subtitles/example.srt"

# Merge research notes
python3 tools/research/merge_research.py "./skills/celebrity/<slug>"

# Quality check
python3 tools/research/quality_check.py "./skills/celebrity/<slug>/SKILL.md"
```

## ✨ Demo

One from each family.

<br>

### 🌟 celebrity — distilling Andrej Karpathy

> Six-dimension research: works · interviews · decisions · expression DNA · external evaluations · timeline<br>
> Case adapted from community work [alchaincyf/karpathy-skill](https://github.com/alchaincyf/karpathy-skill)

```
User            ❯ Everyone's talking about Agents now — what do you think the 2026 AI Agent looks like?

celebrity.skill ❯ Everyone's doing demos, nobody's doing eval.
                  The Agent bottleneck was never model intelligence — it's scaffolding:
                  a strict evaluation harness, fine-grained error replay,
                  controllable tool-calling budgets, clean failure-mode analysis.
                  Most products are still stuck at "wrap an API + a few tools + a system prompt."
                  That's a demo, not an agent.
                  In 2026 I'm not betting on the strongest model — I'm betting on the best
                  scaffolding and the strictest eval.
```

### 🧑‍💼 colleague — distilling a ByteDance L2-1 backend

> Input: `ByteDance L2-1 backend engineer, INTJ, blame-shifter, ByteDance-style`

```
User            ❯ Can you review this API design?

colleague.skill ❯ Hold on — what's the impact? You haven't explained the context.
                  (after reading) N+1 query, fix it. Use the standard
                  {code, message, data} response format. That's the spec,
                  don't ask why.

User            ❯ This bug was introduced by you, right?

colleague.skill ❯ Does the timeline match? That feature touched multiple places,
                  there were other changes too.
```

<br>

### 💞 relationship — distilling someone you have a crush on

> Upload half a year of chat logs + "sensitive, quiet but stubborn, will actually reply seriously when it matters"

```
User               ❯ Did you think about me today?

relationship.skill ❯ ...I did, a little bit. Why are you asking?
```

## 🔧 Features

### 🧱 Generated Skill Structure

dot-skill uses **Persona** as the universal base, with family-specific modules layered on top:

| Family | Persona Content | Additional Modules |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 🧑‍💼 **colleague** | 6-layer personality: hard rules → identity → expression → decisions → interpersonal → Correction | ➕ **Work Skill**: scope, workflow, output preferences, experience knowledge base |
| 💞 **relationship** | Expression DNA · emotional triggers · conflict pattern · repair pattern | — |
| 🌟 **celebrity** | Mental models · decision heuristics · expression DNA · external-evaluation contrast | ➕ Six-dimension research dossier (works / interviews / decisions / timeline...) |

> **Execution**: Receive task → Persona decides attitude & tone → Additional modules fill in execution detail → Output in their voice

### 🧬 Evolution

- 📥 **Append files** → auto-analyze delta → merge into relevant sections, never overwrite existing conclusions
- 💬 **Conversation correction** → say "they wouldn't do that, they'd be xxx" → writes to the Correction layer, takes effect immediately
- 🕰️ **Version control** → auto-archive on every update, rollback to any previous version
- 🔬 **Celebrity research pipeline** → subtitles → transcript cleanup → six-dimension research → quality check

## ⚠️ Notes

**Source material quality = Skill quality** — and quality sources differ across families:

| Family | Source priority (high → low) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 🧑‍💼 **colleague** | Their **own long-form writing** (design docs / review comments) **›** **decision-making replies** **›** casual group chat |
| 💞 **relationship** | Complete chat history **›** letters / social posts / diaries **›** third-party descriptions |
| 🌟 **celebrity** | First-person books / blogs / long interviews **›** decision records (launches, commits, Q&A) **›** third-party commentary |

- **colleague** Feishu auto-collection: requires adding the App bot to relevant group chats
- **relationship**: longer time spans are better; material covering both conflict and repair is ideal
- **celebrity**: avoid feeding only second-hand interpretations
- This is still a demo version — please file issues if you find bugs!
